# PhishGuard AI â€“ Phishing Website Detection ðŸ”’  

PhishGuard AI is a machine learning project that detects **phishing websites** using **XGBoost**, trained on carefully engineered URL and domain features. The model leverages handcrafted indicators extracted from both **PhishTank** (phishing URLs) and **UNB datasets** (benign URLs).  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- **17 handcrafted features** grouped into 3 categories:  
  - **Address Bar features**  
  - **Domain features**  
  - **HTML & JavaScript features**  
- Implements **XGBoost Classifier** for phishing detection.  
- Achieves strong accuracy on both training and testing datasets.  
- Supports easy retraining and extension with new data.  
- Saves trained model (`phishguard_xgb.pkl`) for reuse.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset & Results

- Dataset size: ~10,000 URLs (5,000 phishing + 5,000 legitimate) sourced from:  
  - **PhishTank** (phishing)  
  - **University of New Brunswick (UNB)** dataset (benign)  
- Split: **80% training, 20% testing**.  
- Achieved performance (original project benchmark):  
  - **Train Accuracy**: ~86.7%  
  - **Test Accuracy**: ~85.8%  

ðŸ“Œ *Future Directions*:  
- Add deep learning baselines (LSTM, Transformers on raw URLs).  
- Integrate real-time URL scanning.  
- Deploy as a browser plugin or REST API for live phishing protection.
